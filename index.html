    <h4><b>TEMPLE OF THE TOOTH</b></h4>
    <p> After the Maha parinirvana of <a href="#">Gautama Buddha<a/>, according to the legend, the <a href="#"> tooth relic <a/> was preserved in <a href="#"> Kalinga <a/> and smuggled to the island by Princess Hemamali and her husband, Prince Dantha on the instructions of her father King Guhasiva.Hemmamali hid the relic in her hair on the way to the island. They landed on the island in Lankapattana during the reign of <a href="#"> Sirimeghavanna of Anuradhapura<a/> (301-328) and handed over the tooth relic. The king enshrined it in Meghagiri Vihara (present day <a href="#"> Isurumuniya <a/>) in <a href="#"> Anuradhapura <a/>. Safeguarding the relic was the responsibility of the monarch from then, therefore over the years, the custodianship of relic came to symbolize the right to rule the island. Therefore, reigning monarchs built the tooth relic temples quite close to their royal residences, as was the case during the times of the <a href="#"> Anuradhapura Kingdom, Kingdom of Polonnaruwa <a/>, and <a href="#"> Kingdom of Dambadeniya <a/>. During the era of the <a href="#"> Kingdom of Gampola <a/>, the relic was housed in Niyamgampaya Vihara. It is reported in the messenger poems such as <a href="#"> Hamsa <a/>, Gira, and Selalihini that the temple of tooth relic was situated within the city of <a href="#"> Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte <a/> when the <a href="#"> Kingdom of Kotte <a/> was established there.</p>
